# Code against Climate Change
üî•üåè **Code against Climate Change** is a curated list of tech projects against climate change - hoping to inspire disruptive technological climate action!

**Climate change is the biggest threat of our generation.** Emissions are rising and according to the newest [IPCC report](https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/), we are heading towards an [unprecedented disaster](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-report-half-degree.html).
[Political outrage](https://rebellion.earth/) is slowly forming but we also need *technological disruptions*! This living list aims to *educate* hackers and developers on promising tech projects against climate change, *hoping to inspire immediate and disruptive technological climate action!*

## üîå Energy 

- Electricity Generation accounts for **around 40 percent of all emissions** to the atmosphere, making it the highest-emitting sector in the world. 
- Fossil fuels represent 67 percent, nuclear 11 percent, and renewable energy sources just over 24 percent (and growing) of total worldwide electricity generation.

**Solutions:** In the last few years, the competitiveness of renewable sources for electricity generation has continued to increase due to the price evolution and the efficiency improvements of these technologies.

- [FHI360](https://www.fhi360.org/practice-areas/technology) collects, analyzes and sends out agricultural advisories, crop and livestock market information and weather data to Ugandan farmers, who are among the most affected by the impacts of climate change. As a result, farmers are able to minimize crop loss and damage, making them more resilient to global warming.
- [ICTs For Small-Scale Farmers](https://unfccc.int/climate-action/momentum-for-change/ict-solutions/icts-for-small-scale-farmers-a-game-changing-approach-to-climate-smart-agriculture-in-latin-america) in Colombia and Honduras
leverages sensors and tools that collects, collates, and analyzes weather data to inform farmers in advance on how to adjust their agricultural practices to ensure maximum crop-yield and thus food security.

## üå≤ Land Use 

- Deforestation and degradation of forest ecosystems are responsible for about **10-15 percent of all emissions** today. 

**Solutions:** Land use solutions reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation of ecosystems.
